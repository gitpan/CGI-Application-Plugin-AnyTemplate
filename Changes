Revision history for CGI-Application-Plugin-AnyTemplate

0.06    July 10, 2005
        - allowed templates to be created from strings (works in all
          drivers except Petal):

             $self->template->load(string => \$some_text);
             $self->template->load(\$some_text);


0.05    Jun 15, 2005
        - changed embedded components from 'dispatch' to 'embed' to
          avoid confusion with CGI::Application::Dispatch

          This is an incompatible API change, which hopefully won't
          actually affect anybody since I don't think there are any
          users of AnyTemplate yet.

          The default syntax has changed from:
              CGIAPP_dispatch, CGIAPP.dispatch, CGIAPP/dispatch, etc.
          to:
              CGIAPP_embed, CGIAPP.embed, CGIAPP/embed, etc.

          The old syntax still works to embed components in TT and
          Petal (but is undocumented). Users of HTML::Template and
          HTML::Template::Expr can return to the old syntax by setting
          embed_tag_name to 'cgiapp_dispatch'

          Related API changes:
          - CAP:AnyTemplate::Dispatcher has been renamed to
            CAP:AnyTemplate::ComponentHandler

          - the dispatcher_class option has been renamed to
            component_handler class

          - the dispatch_tag_name driver config key has been renamed to
            embed_tag_name
